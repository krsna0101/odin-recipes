<h1>Recipes project from Odin Project</h1>
<p>Hey guys !</p>
<p>This is my first ever project here. I made a recipes webpage and it's pretty good. If any of you guys are wondering what "Maggi" is on my webpage then let me tell you it's a very popular packaged instant noodles in India.</p>
<h2>What did I learn ?</h2>
<h4>Git and GitHub</h4>
<p>I learnt how to clone GitHub repositories on my command line, work on them from the command line, stage and commit changes and then finally push the code back to GitHub.</p> <p>I then learnt how to create repositories on GitHub and how to work on them and how to navigate yourself on the website.</p>
<h4>HTML</h4>
I learnt to create a whole HTML webpage from scratch, what more do I need to say ! I now know all the basic tags, how to make absolute and relative links on my files, how to get images on my webpages and make overall good webpage.
<strong><h5>Thanks for reading this through. Take a look at my project too. The next stop is now CSS and building a kick-ass landing page.</h5></strong>
